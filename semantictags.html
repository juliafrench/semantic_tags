      <h1>Cathedral</h1>  
        <p>George and I did another East Coast Odyssey and this time spent a few days in DC-- landing at the <a href="http://www.omnihotels.com/hotels/washington-dc-shoreham.">Omni Hotel</a> (place of presidential stays). After we had done the downtown museums, he insisted on showing me the National Cathedral, which was uptown DC and not far from our hotel. When we got there, I was blown away by the beauty of this historic place.</p>

      <h4>2011 Earthquake</h4>
        <p>We noticed a lot of scaffolding and in general, work being done. I later read <a href="http://www.thewire.com/national/2011/08/what-really-happened-national-cathedral-quake/41644/">this article</a> about the 5.8 earthquake that displaced the Cathedral's buttresses and twisted pinnacles to the tune of $26 million in damages. Gargoyles were damaged and a gaping hole was left in the roof.</p>
